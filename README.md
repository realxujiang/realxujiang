Hi, I'm 锡流, an open source lover.

My current main interest is in databases systems.

I'm also a big fan of Rust language and try to involve the Rust community.

Currently I am working on the database engine of hetudb at @hetudb.

I used to worked in the Snowberg team at Alibaba and am responsible for developing query engine and storage features.

> Snowberg is a project that serves Alibaba's internal e-commerce scenarios. Built on top of MySQL sharding, it supports secondary indexes and full-text indexes (based on Lucene). It also supports materialized and full-text index table engines. Snowberg adopts a storage-computation separation architecture and is deployed in a multi-region manner. It serves various full-text search and online OLTP needs in e-commerce scenarios.
> Serverless database is designed to provide multi-tenant management, comprehensive SQL support, and programmable SDK capabilities. Internally, it is primarily used in OLTP scenarios where data access is performed using programmable SDK.
